# Note Taker

## Description
This assignemnt was provided to me by the Georgia Tech Coding Bootcamp program. The assignment came with starter code, so all of the front-end coding was done. I coded the back-end (server.js).

The application is a note-taker app which allows the user to add a title and body to a note, click the save button, and it will populate on the left-hand sidebar.

## Installation
The user will require the ```express``` library. To install this library, run ```npm i express``` in your terminal: 

## Instructions
Run the app through the terminal using this command: ```node server.js```.
While the server is running, you should be able to create a new note and post it to the server.
